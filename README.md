# React + TypeScript Project

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or later recommended)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

### Install Dependencies

### Run Locally (Development)
This project uses `webpack-dev-server` for local development with hot reloading:

This will open your app in the browser at `http://localhost:8080` by default.

The output will be in the `dist/` folder.
